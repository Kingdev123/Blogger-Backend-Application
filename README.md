# Blogger-Backend-Application

I developed a backend application for a blogger platform using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL. The project implements RESTful APIs for user management, post creation, category handling, and comment functionalities. It employs Hibernate for efficient data management, supporting various relationships like many-to-many and one-to-many. Spring Data JPA facilitates the data access layer, simplifying CRUD operations and enhancing code maintainability. The system's architecture enables users to create posts, assign them to multiple categories, and receive comments. By utilizing Spring Boot's robust features, I ensured seamless integration of frontend interfaces with the backend services. Overall, the project demonstrates my proficiency in Java development, Spring Boot framework, ORM techniques with Hibernate, MySQL database handling, and RESTful API design, showcasing my ability to create scalable and maintainable backend solutions for blogging platforms.
